# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Testing

Please write test for new code you create. Run:

```bash
bundle exec rake test
```

## Submitting changes

Please send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/DataDog/graft-rb/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include tests. We can always use more test coverage.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

If in doubt, follow [this](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. To avoid bikeshedding, run `bundle exec rubocop` and everything be fine.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks
